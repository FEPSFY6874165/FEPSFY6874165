    This article explores whether the human brain is inherently structured for mathematical tasks. Although math is integral to daily activities 
    such as cooking, sports, music, its processing involves multiple brain regions, including the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal 
    lobes. Humans have an innate number sense and excel at pattern recognition, spatial awareness, and symbolic thinking, key for understanding 
    and solving mathematical problems. Differences in mathematical ability may stem from exposure and practice rather than innate intelligence, 
    as skill tends to fade without use. While the brain may not be exclusively designed for math, its flexible architecture enables humans to 
    adapt to maths-related tasks effectively.

    Mathematics is an integral part of daily life, extending far beyond its applications in finance, loans, or monetary matters. It plays a role 
    in activities such as cooking, analysing sports strategies, and even creating music. These are just a few examples of how math integrates 
    into everyday routines. The discipline equips individuals with essential skills to analyse data, recognise patterns, and devise innovative 
    solutions to complex challenges (Superprof, 2024). These abilities are introduced to children to support their problem-solving capabilities 
    later in life. However, despite living in a world deeply intertwined with mathematics.

    Mathematical processing in the brain involves a wide range of regions, including the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes across 
    both hemispheres (University of Maryland, 2024). This widespread involvement of all the brain's lobes highlights the significant cognitive 
    effort required for mathematical tasks. Humans possess an innate, preverbal ability to distinguish between quantities, indicating an inherent 
    "number sense" rather than one acquired entirely through learning (PMC, 2018).
    
    The brain excels in recognising patterns and solving problems, both of which are fundamental to mathematics. Spatial and visual processing 
    also play a critical role, allowing the brain to understand the relationships between objects in space. The dorsal stream sends information 
    to the parietal lobe, focusing on spatial processing, while the ventral stream projects to the inferior temporal lobe, handling object 
    recognition (PubMed, 1999). This dual-stream system enables humans to grasp geometric concepts, visualise patterns, and solve complex 
    mathematical problems with greater ease (Magrid Education, 2024).
    
    Abstract and symbolic thinking further enhance mathematical abilities. Abstract thinking enables individuals to consider concepts and ideas 
    without direct physical representation, while symbolic thinking allows for the use of symbols to represent other objects or ideas 
    (GoodTherapy, 2024). The prefrontal cortex, which governs logic, reasoning, judgment, and creativity, plays a crucial role in these processes. 
    For instance, the left middle frontal cortex is engaged during addition and subtraction, while multiplication activates both the left middle 
    and inferior frontal cortices (ScienceDirect, 2017). Cognitive flexibility, the brain's ability to switch between different concepts or think 
    about multiple ideas simultaneously, also contributes to mathematical proficiency. This flexibility enhances problem-solving efficiency and 
    accuracy in mathematical tasks (ScienceDirect, 2024). Collectively, these neural functions and abilities demonstrate how the brain's intricate 
    processing capabilities underpin our capacity for mathematical thought.

    Differences in individuals' mathematical abilities often depend on their exposure to foundational concepts and the consistency with which they 
    engage in mathematical practice throughout their lives. Regular practice and application of mathematical skills significantly impact proficiency. 
    However, some individuals appear to have a natural aptitude for mathematics. These individuals often exhibit an innate awareness of quantitative 
    information, grasping mathematical concepts with ease and displaying talent from an early age.
    
    A common misconception about mathematical ability is its direct correlation with IQ. While a higher IQ can sometimes indicate mathematical 
    aptitude, this is not universally true. Even accomplished mathematicians may have average or below-average IQ scores. Interestingly, research 
    suggests that practicing mathematics can enhance cognitive abilities, including IQ.

    Figure 1 highlights a study where monkeys' performance in addition declined over time when they stopped practicing the skill (Cantlon, 2012). 
    The study showed that performance peaked at over 90% accuracy in September 2008, but there was a noticeable decline after January 2009 due to 
    lack of practice. This trend parallels human experiencesâ€”mathematical abilities can diminish without consistent use. This variability in practice 
    and exposure explains why some individuals excel more in mathematics than others.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
  <p class-"ex1">
  <pre>
    Overall, there are a lot of factors that can affect how good at maths one can be however the brain does provide humans with all the necessary 
    abilities to understand and do maths from the mathematical processing in the brain to the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, the brain is always 
    capable of doing maths but needs practice in order to reach a high level like many other skills in life. The brain in itself may not be designed 
    to do maths but in the world as it has evolved to be maths is a necessity that humans need and therefore the brain has used the required abilities 
    it maintains of in order to provide the mathematical skills that all human use.
